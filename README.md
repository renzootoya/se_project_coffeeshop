# Triple Peaks Coffee Shop

This is the second project of the Software Engineering program at TripleTen. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on the design brief.

## Project features

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Positioning
- Flat BEM file structure
- A custom form
- CSS animation and transform

## Plan on improving the project

One improvement I would like to explore is adding a responsive design to ensure the website is optimized for all devices, including mobile phones and tablets. Currently, the site is designed with desktop users in mind, and implementing media would help the layout adapt to different screen sizes, providing a better user experience on mobile devices.
